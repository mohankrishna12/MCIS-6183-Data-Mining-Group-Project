# A SYSTEM TO PREDICT MOVIE RATINGS WITH IMDB DATA AND R PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE.

# OVERVIEW
This project would provide a model to predict personal user movie ratings. The personal user ratings would compare with IMDB ratings for a set of 400 movies.
users predictions would be based on different predictors like IMDB ratings, year of release, Genre and directors.the application helps to predict a new movie and a customer 
can decide whether to book ticket ahead.

# DATA
We got the dataset from [IMDB Website] (http://www.imdb.com/user/ur49179813/ratings) but we plan to use subset of the dataset. we got 400 movies downloaded in an Excel sheet in CSV format. The dataset has these attributes (columns): position, const, date and time created,
title, title type, directors, demetriodor-880-20065 rated, IMBD rating, runtime (mins), year, genre, number votes, released date(month\day\year) and URL.the data is laid out to be human readable not 
machine-readable the data is generally consistent.

# RESEARCH QUESTIONS
- Can this application correctly predict the success or failure of the movies based on actor,actress or director previous historical data
- What if the historical data collated about actor,actress and director on which the prediction of success or failure of movies were wrong
- Can there be other ways to predict the success or failure of movies?
- If some actors,actresses or directors failed movies data were collated when they started their careers but improved on the success of their
movies as they gained experience in the industry. is it right to predict the success or failure of their recent movies based on past data 
collated?

# CODE AND APPLICATION
The models in this application would be built and tested using R programming language. R is a freely available language and environment for statistical computing
and graphics which provides a wide variety of statistical and graphical techniques like linear or non-linear modelling, statistical tests, time series analysis, 
classification, clustering etc. The integrated development environment on which the models would be built is RStudio, which is a set of integrated tools designed to be more productive with R. it includes a console, 
syntax-highlighting editor that supports direct code execution.

# TEAM
| Team Member | Roles and skills | Contributions |
| ----------- | ---------------- | ------------- |
| Uchendu Korieocha | I developed the Project proposal and i would be editing the R programming codes i got from IMDB website. i'm proficient in Microsoft C# programming language but i've a good understanding on how codes work. though i'm new to R programming language, i'm using youtube video tutorials uploaded by our instructor to have basic understanding on how R works.i"ve strong analytical skills,i can work as a team in an organized way.all these i would bring to the successful completion of the project. | After successful meetings with my team members, we agreed to develop an application to predict personal users movie ratings using different predictors on the dataset. this stage of the project is a successful compiled proposal to explain what the project is all about. |

| Dimosh Pradhan |                   |I also will be creating the powerpoint slides for our project which explains the full details of the project and has some screenshots of our application.  |
# DELIVERABLES AND CHECKPOINTS
| Checkpoint Date | Expected Deliverable | Responsible Team Member(s) | Checkpoints Results |
| --------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------- |
| 02-15-2016 | Project Proposal | Uchendu Korieocha | We agreed to work together on how to predict personal users ratings as clearly stated on the proposal. At this point we searched for dataset to suit our project.   |
| 03-13-2016 | Compiled dataset | Tribikya Thapa | We got a Dataset on MovieLens that lacked some variables like names of directors,actors and actresses. we created random names of directors,actors and actresses, which made the dataset rigid, incorrect and difficult to give the required outcome. with this, we did more research to get a better dataset|
| 04-14-2016 | Compiled dataset from IMDB website | Chigozie Mozie | After our previous failed attempts to compile a good dataset, my team members and i stumbled on a rich dataset on IMDB website, my role was to downloaded it on an Excel sheet, cleaned it up to get a subset of the overall dataset. we've 400 movies to work with now.|
| 04-18-2016 | Codes Analysis | Uchendu Korieocha | i got a source code on IMDB to work with our 400 movies, at this point i'm analyzing the codes to get the best way it can work with our dataset. in a couple of days, the codes would use the data to predict personal users ratings.|
